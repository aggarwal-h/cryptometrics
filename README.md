# CryptoMetrics

CryptoMetrics is an open-source NextJS app that addresses the need to view trending cryptocurrency prices. It includes features for comparing multiple cryptocurrencies together, viewing detailed timeseries charts, filtering based on specific properties and viewing an aggregate analysis. This project uses the [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) API to fetch data and handles the filtering on the front-end.

Note: This project was [originally](https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/webapp/webapp_l02_grp15/) done as part of the SFWRENG 3XA3 course at McMaster University.



### Instructions:
